/**
 * Annotation that marks methods which are to be invoked when a packet is
 * received or an event is thrown. To be eligible to be a Listener, a method
 * must: 1) be public, 2) have a void return type, and 3) have exactly one
 * argument of an accepted type ({@link net.dhleong.acl.protocol.ArtemisPacket},
 * {@link net.dhleong.acl.iface.ConnectionEvent}, or any of their subtypes). The
 * method will only be notified of packets or events that are assignable to the
 * argument's type.
 * 
 * Annotating the method alone is not enough to get notifications; you must
 * register the object that has the annotated method with the
 * ArtemisNetworkInterface implementation that will be receiving the packets or
 * events.
