ArtClientLib
============
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rjwut/ArtClientLib.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/rjwut/ArtClientLib)

**ArtClientLib** is an _unofficial_ Java library for developing clients to interact with [Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator](http://www.artemis.eochu.com/). It was originally developed by Daniel Leong and released here on GitHub with permission of the developer of Artemis, Thom Robertson.

This fork of the ArtClientLib project was created in order to update the project to be compatible with Artemis 2.0. It is not intended that this branch will be compatible with older versions of Artemis. If you need support for Artemis 1.x, please use [the original version of the library](https://github.com/dhleong/ArtClientLib). This fork is under active development and does not yet fully implement all the new features of Artemis 2.0.

It is recommended that you read the [disclaimer](https://github.com/rjwut/ArtClientLib/wiki/Disclaimer) before using ArtClientLib.

Documentation for the project is found on the [wiki](https://github.com/rjwut/ArtClientLib/wiki).
