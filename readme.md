ArtClientLib
============
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rjwut/ArtClientLib.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/rjwut/ArtClientLib)

**ArtClientLib** is an _unofficial_ Java library for developing clients to interact with [Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator](http://www.artemis.eochu.com/). It supports Artemis version 2.0 or later.

Documentation for the project is found on the [wiki](https://github.com/rjwut/ArtClientLib/wiki). Please also read the [disclaimer](https://github.com/rjwut/ArtClientLib/wiki/Disclaimer) before using ArtClientLib.

ArtClientLib was originally developed by Daniel Leong and released on GitHub with permission of the developer of Artemis, Thom Robertson. If you require compatibility with legacy (pre-2.0) versions of Artemis, [his original version of ArtClientLib](https://github.com/dhleong/ArtClientLib) can be used for that purpose.
